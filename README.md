# Project 14: Model-View-Controller (MVC) Challenge
## Tech Blog
Writing about tech can be just as important as making it. Developers spend plenty of time creating new applications and debugging existing codebases, but most developers also spend at least some of their time reading and writing about technical concepts, recent advancements, and new technologies.

The purpose of this project was to built a CMS-style blog site - similar to a WordPress site - where developers could publish their blog posts and comment on other developers' posts as well. This application follows the MVC paradigm in its architecture structure, atilizes Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
